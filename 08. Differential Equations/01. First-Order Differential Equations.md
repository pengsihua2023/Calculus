## I. Basic Concepts

1. **First-order differential equation**: An equation involving an unknown function and its **first derivative**, in general form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y)
$$

2. **Definition of solution**: A function \$y(x)\$ that satisfies the equation on some interval.

3. **Initial value problem**: A solution satisfying the condition \$y(x\_0)=y\_0\$ at a given point \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$.

## II. Common Types and Methods

### 1. Separable variables equation

Form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)
$$

Method: Variable separation â†’ Integration

$$
\int \frac{dy}{g(y)} = \int f(x)\,dx
$$

### 2. First-order linear equation

Form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
$$

Method: Integrating factor

$$
\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\,dx}
$$

General solution:

$$
y = e^{-\int P(x)\,dx}\Big(\int Q(x)e^{\int P(x)\,dx}\,dx + C\Big)
$$

### 3. Homogeneous equation

Form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

Method: Let \$u=y/x \Rightarrow y=ux\$, reduce to separable variables form.

### 4. Bernoulli Equation

Form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)y^n
$$

Method: Substitution \$z=y^{1-n}\$, transform into a first-order linear equation.

### 5. Exact equation

Form:

$$
M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy=0
$$

Condition:

$$
\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}
$$

Method: Find potential function \$\varphi(x,y)\$ such that

$$
\varphi_x = M, \quad \varphi_y = N \quad \Rightarrow \quad \varphi(x,y)=C
$$

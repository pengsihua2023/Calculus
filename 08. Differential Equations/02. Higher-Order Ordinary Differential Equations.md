## I. Basic Concepts

1. **Higher-order ODE**: An equation involving an unknown function and its higher-order derivatives, in general form:

$$
F\big(x,y,y',y'',\dots,y^{(n)}\big)=0
$$

2. **Linear equation**:

$$
y^{(n)}+a_1(x)y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_{n-1}(x)y'+a_n(x)y=f(x)
$$

It is called **homogeneous** if \$f(x)=0\$, otherwise **nonhomogeneous**.

3. **General solution composition**:

* **General solution of homogeneous equation** + **Particular solution of nonhomogeneous equation** = **General solution of nonhomogeneous equation**.

## II. Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients

Form:

$$
y^{(n)}+a_1 y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_{n-1}y'+a_n y=0
$$

1. **Characteristic equation**

$$
\lambda^n+a_1\lambda^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}\lambda+a_n=0
$$

2. **Cases of solutions**

* **\$n\$ distinct real roots**:

$$
y=C_1e^{\lambda_1 x}+C_2e^{\lambda_2 x}+\cdots+C_ne^{\lambda_n x}
$$

* **Repeated root (multiplicity \$k\$ of \$\lambda\$)**:

$$
(C_1+C_2x+\cdots+C_k x^{k-1})e^{\lambda x}
$$

* **Conjugate complex roots \$\alpha\pm i\beta\$**:

$$
e^{\alpha x}(C_1\cos \beta x+C_2\sin \beta x)
$$

## III. Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients

Form:

$$
y^{(n)}+a_1 y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_n y=f(x)
$$

1. **General solution**

$$
y(x)=y_h(x)+y_p(x)
$$

where \$y\_h\$ is the solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, and \$y\_p\$ is a particular solution.

2. **Common methods for particular solutions**

* **Method of undetermined coefficients**: When \$f(x)\$ is exponential, trigonometric, polynomial, or their products, assume a solution of the same type and solve for coefficients.
* **Method of variation of parameters (Lagrangeâ€™s method)**: A more general method for complex \$f(x)\$.

## IV. Common Special Cases

1. **Second-order homogeneous equation with constant coefficients**

$$
y''+ay'+by=0
$$

* Discriminant \$\Delta=a^2-4b\$

  * \$\Delta>0\$: real roots, exponential solutions;
  * \$\Delta=0\$: repeated root, solution contains \$x e^{\lambda x}\$;
  * \$\Delta<0\$: complex roots, solution is exponential growth/decay Ã— sine/cosine.

2. **Second-order nonhomogeneous equation**

$$
y''+ay'+by=f(x)
$$

Solution: homogeneous general solution + particular solution.

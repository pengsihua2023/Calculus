# ðŸŒŸ 10 Exercises: Differential Equations in Finance

## **1. Simple Interest â€“ Savings Growth**

**Problem:** A deposit of \$1,000 earns **5% simple interest per year**. Find the value after 10 years.

**Solution:**
Formula:

$$
A(t)=A_0(1+rt).
$$

Here $A_0=1000,\ r=0.05,\ t=10.$

$$
A(10)=1000(1+0.05\cdot 10)=1000(1+0.5)=1500.
$$

âœ… Final: After 10 years, \$1,500.

---

## **2. Simple Interest â€“ Reverse Problem**

**Problem:** An investment grew to \$2,400 in 8 years at simple interest rate 6%. Find the initial principal.

**Solution:**

$$
A(t)=A_0(1+rt).
$$

So, $2400=A_0(1+0.06\cdot 8)=A_0(1+0.48)=1.48A_0.$

$$
A_0=\frac{2400}{1.48}\approx 1621.62.
$$

âœ… Final: Initial deposit â‰ˆ \$1,621.62.

---

## **3. Compound Interest â€“ Continuous Growth**

**Problem:** A savings account has principal \$5,000 with **annual compound rate 8%**. Find the value after 15 years (continuous compounding).

**Solution:**
ODE: $\tfrac{dA}{dt}=0.08A,\ \Rightarrow A(t)=5000e^{0.08t}.$
At $t=15:$

$$
A(15)=5000e^{1.2}\approx 5000\cdot 3.3201=16600.5.
$$

âœ… Final: \$16,600.50.

---

## **4. Compound Interest â€“ Doubling Time**

**Problem:** How long will it take an investment to **double** at 7% continuous compound interest?

**Solution:**
Equation: $2A_0=A_0e^{0.07t}$.

$$
2=e^{0.07t}\quad\Rightarrow\quad t=\frac{\ln 2}{0.07}\approx 9.90\ \text{years}.
$$

âœ… Final: About 9.9 years.

---

## **5. Discounting â€“ Present Value of a Bond**

**Problem:** A bond will pay \$10,000 in 5 years. The continuous discount rate is 4%. Find its present value.

**Solution:**
Formula: $A_0=A(t)e^{-rt}.$

$$
A_0=10000e^{-0.04\cdot 5}=10000e^{-0.2}\approx 10000(0.8187)=8187.
$$

âœ… Final: Present value â‰ˆ \$8,187.

---

## **6. Discounting â€“ Required Future Value**

**Problem:** You want the present value to be \$5,000 when the payment occurs in 3 years. The continuous interest rate is 6%. How much must the future payment be?

**Solution:**
$A_0=A(t)e^{-rt}.$
So, $5000=A(t)e^{-0.18}.$

$$
A(t)=5000e^{0.18}\approx 5000(1.1972)=5986.
$$

âœ… Final: Future payment â‰ˆ \$5,986.

---

## **7. Annuity â€“ Retirement Fund**

**Problem:** You deposit \$2,000 each year into a fund that earns 5% continuously. Find the value after 20 years, assuming no initial amount.

**Solution:**
ODE: $A'(t)=0.05A(t)+2000.$
Solution:

$$
A(t)=\Big(A_0+\tfrac{C}{r}\Big)e^{rt}-\tfrac{C}{r},\quad A_0=0,\ r=0.05,\ C=2000.
$$

$$
A(20)=\Big(0+\frac{2000}{0.05}\Big)e^{1}-\frac{2000}{0.05}=40000e-40000.
$$

$$
A(20)=40000(2.718-1)=40000(1.718)=68720.
$$

âœ… Final: â‰ˆ \$68,720.

## **8. Annuity â€“ Loan Repayment**

**Problem:** A loan of \$50,000 is repaid with continuous installments at rate \$C) while interest is 4%. After 10 years, the balance must be 0. Find required $C$.

**Solution:**
ODE: $A'(t)=0.04A(t)-C,\ A(0)=50000,\ A(10)=0.$
Solution:

$$
A(t)=(A_0-\tfrac{C}{r})e^{rt}+\tfrac{C}{r}.
$$

So:

$$
0=(50000-\tfrac{C}{0.04})e^{0.4}+\tfrac{C}{0.04}.
$$

$$
(50000-\tfrac{C}{0.04})(1.4918)+\tfrac{C}{0.04}=0.
$$

$$
74590-37.295C+25C=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad -12.295C=-74590.
$$

$$
C=6067.9.
$$

âœ… Final: Continuous payment rate â‰ˆ \$6,068/year.

## **9. Portfolio Growth â€“ Stock Price Projection**

**Problem:** A stock price is modeled as $S(t)=S_0e^{\mu t},$ with $S_0=100,\ \mu=0.08.$ Predict the stock price after 5 years.

**Solution:**

$$
S(5)=100e^{0.08\cdot 5}=100e^{0.4}\approx 100(1.4918)=149.18.
$$

âœ… Final: \$149.18.

---

## **10. Portfolio Growth â€“ Expected Return with Volatility Ignored**

**Problem:** A portfolio of \$20,000 has expected return rate 10%. Ignoring volatility, find its value after 12 years.

**Solution:**

$$
S(t)=S_0e^{\mu t}=20000e^{0.1\cdot 12}=20000e^{1.2}.
$$

$$
=20000(3.3201)=66402.
$$

âœ… Final: â‰ˆ \$66,402.

# Differential Equations: Simple Applications (Five Financial Models)

The main knowledge points in this section are divided into **Modeling Ideas ‚Üí Five Typical Models ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Key Points Summary**.

## I. Modeling Ideas

1. **Core idea**: The rate of change of financial quantities (funds, bonds, stocks, portfolios, etc.) is often proportional to themselves or the external environment.
2. **Mathematical tool**: First-order ordinary differential equations (mostly of the type \$\tfrac{dy}{dt}=ky\$).
3. **Goal**: Solve the equation to obtain future value, present value, price trends, or risk measures.

## II. Five Typical Financial Models

### 1. Simple Interest

* Assume the interest is proportional only to the principal \$A\_0\$:

$$
A(t) = A_0(1+rt)
$$

* **Linear growth**, with a fixed growth rate over time.

---

### 2. Compound Interest

* Interest is added to the principal, satisfying:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt}=rA
$$

* Solution:

$$
A(t)=A_0e^{rt}
$$

* **Exponential growth**, reflecting ‚Äúinterest on interest.‚Äù

### 3. Continuous Compounding & Discounting

* Future value:

$$
A(t)=A_0e^{rt}
$$

* Present value (discounting):

$$
A_0=A(t)e^{-rt}
$$

* Applications: bond pricing, investment evaluation.

---

### 4. Annuities

* If a fixed cash flow \$C\$ is invested each period, the accumulated fund satisfies:

$$
A'(t)=rA(t)+C
$$

* Solution:

$$
A(t)=\Big(A_0+\frac{C}{r}\Big)e^{rt}-\frac{C}{r}
$$

* Applications: pensions, loan repayment.

### 5. Portfolio Growth Model (Prototype of Black‚ÄìScholes)

* Assume the portfolio return rate is \$\mu\$:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt}=\mu S
\quad \Rightarrow \quad S(t)=S_0 e^{\mu t}
$$

* If risk (volatility \$\sigma\$) is introduced, it leads to a **stochastic differential equation**:

$$
dS = \mu S\,dt + \sigma S\,dW_t
$$

(In calculus courses, usually only the deterministic part \$\tfrac{dS}{dt}=\mu S\$ is introduced.)

## III. Applications

1. **Simple/Compound interest**: savings, loans, debt growth.
2. **Continuous compounding & discounting**: bond pricing, derivative valuation.
3. **Annuity model**: pensions, mortgages, installment payments.
4. **Portfolio model**: stock market return forecasting, risk management.

## IV. Key Points Summary

1. **Five model formulas**:

   * Simple interest: \$A(t)=A\_0(1+rt)\$
   * Compound interest: \$A(t)=A\_0e^{rt}\$
   * Discounting: \$A\_0=A(t)e^{-rt}\$
   * Annuities: \$A(t)=(A\_0+\tfrac{C}{r})e^{rt}-\tfrac{C}{r}\$
   * Portfolio: \$S(t)=S\_0e^{\mu t}\$

2. **Core mathematical structure**: Most are **first-order ODEs** (separable/linear equations).

3. **Economic meaning**:

   * Simple interest ‚Üí linear growth;
   * Compound interest ‚Üí exponential growth;
   * Discounting ‚Üí present value of future cash flows;
   * Annuities ‚Üí accumulation of investments and loans;
   * Portfolio ‚Üí modeling of returns and risks.

üìå **One-Sentence Summary**:
The ‚ÄúFive Financial Models‚Äù demonstrate the fundamental applications of differential equations in finance: **simple interest ‚Üí compound interest ‚Üí discounting ‚Üí annuities ‚Üí portfolio**, essentially describing the relationship between growth rate and capital, with solutions in linear or exponential forms.

# Sequences and Limits

## I. Basic Concept of Sequences

1. **Definition of a Sequence**

   * A sequence is a set of real numbers arranged in a certain order, usually denoted as \${a\_n}\$ or \${a\_n}\_{n=1}^\infty\$.
   * Essence: A sequence is a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers \$\mathbb{N}\$.

2. **Representation of Sequences**

   * Explicit formula (general term formula): e.g., \$a\_n = \frac{1}{n}\$.
   * Recursive formula: e.g., \$a\_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(a\_n+ \frac{1}{a\_n})\$.
   * Listing method: e.g., \$1, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{3}, \dots\$.

3. **Common Sequences**

   * Arithmetic sequence: \$a\_n = a\_1 + (n-1)d\$.
   * Geometric sequence: \$a\_n = a\_1 q^{n-1}\$.

## II. Limit of a Sequence

1. **Definition of a Limit**

   * \$\lim\_{n \to \infty} a\_n = A\$, if for any \$\varepsilon > 0\$, there exists a positive integer \$N\$, such that when \$n > N\$, \$|a\_n - A| < \varepsilon\$.
   * If the limit exists, the sequence is called **convergent**, and the limit value is \$A\$; if not, it is called **divergent**.

2. **Several Cases of Limits**

   * Converging to a finite value (e.g., \$\frac{1}{n} \to 0\$).
   * Diverging to positive infinity (e.g., \$n \to +\infty\$).
   * Diverging to negative infinity (e.g., \$-n \to -\infty\$).
   * Oscillatory divergence (e.g., \$(-1)^n\$).

3. **Properties of Convergent Sequences**

   * Uniqueness of the limit.
   * Boundedness (a convergent sequence must be bounded).
   * Sign preservation (if the limit is greater than 0, then for sufficiently large \$n\$ the sequence remains positive).

## III. Limit Operations and Theorems

1. **Four Arithmetic Operation Theorem**

   * If \$\lim a\_n = A, \lim b\_n = B\$, then:
     \$\lim (a\_n \pm b\_n) = A \pm B\$
     \$\lim (a\_n b\_n) = AB\$
     \$\lim \frac{a\_n}{b\_n} = \frac{A}{B} \ (B \neq 0)\$

2. **Squeeze Theorem**

   * If \$a\_n \leq b\_n \leq c\_n\$, and \$\lim a\_n = \lim c\_n = L\$, then \$\lim b\_n = L\$.

3. **Monotone Bounded Theorem**

   * If a sequence is monotone and bounded, then it must be convergent.

4. **Important Limits**

   * \$\lim\_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0\$
   * \$\lim\_{n\to\infty} (1+\frac{1}{n})^n = e\$
   * \$\lim\_{n\to\infty} \sqrt\[n]{a} = 1 \ (a>0)\$

## IV. Infinitesimal and Infinite Quantities

1. **Infinitesimal**: When \$n \to \infty\$, if \$a\_n \to 0\$, \$a\_n\$ is called an infinitesimal.

   * Properties of infinitesimals: the sum of finitely many infinitesimals is still infinitesimal; the product of a bounded sequence and an infinitesimal is still infinitesimal.

2. **Infinite Quantity**: When \$n \to \infty\$, if \$|a\_n| \to +\infty\$, \$a\_n\$ is called an infinite quantity.

# Continuity and Discontinuities

Main knowledge points of this section. This section is the concrete application of the limit concept to functions and forms the foundation for learning derivatives and integrals later.

## I. Continuity of Functions

### 1. Definition of Continuity at a Point

Suppose a function \$f(x)\$ is defined near \$x=a\$:

* \$f(x)\$ is continuous at \$a\$ ‚áî the following three conditions hold:

  1. \$f(a)\$ is defined;
  2. \$\lim\_{x\to a} f(x)\$ exists;
  3. \$\lim\_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)\$.

Symbolically:

$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)
$$

### 2. One-Sided Continuity

* If \$\lim\_{x\to a^-} f(x) = f(a)\$, it is called **left continuity**;
* If \$\lim\_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a)\$, it is called **right continuity**.

## II. Discontinuities of Functions

### 1. Definition of Discontinuity

If a function is **not continuous** at some point, that point is called a **discontinuity**.

### 2. Classification of Discontinuities

#### (1) Removable Discontinuity

* Definition: The left and right limits exist and are equal, but do not equal the function value \$f(a)\$, or \$f(a)\$ is undefined.
* Feature: By ‚Äúfilling in‚Äù or redefining the function value, continuity can be restored.
* Example: \$f(x)=\frac{\sin x}{x},\ f(0)\$ is undefined, but \$\lim\_{x\to0} f(x)=1\$. At \$x=0\$, it is a removable discontinuity.

---

#### (2) Jump Discontinuity

* Definition: \$\lim\_{x\to a^-} f(x)\$ and \$\lim\_{x\to a^+} f(x)\$ both exist but are not equal.
* Feature: The graph of the function has a ‚Äújump‚Äù at that point.
* Example: The sign function \$f(x)=\text{sgn}(x)\$ at \$x=0\$ is a jump discontinuity.

---

#### (3) Infinite Discontinuity

* Definition: As \$x\to a\$, the function value tends to \$\infty\$ or \$-\infty\$.
* Feature: The graph of the function has an ‚Äúinfinite break‚Äù at that point.
* Example: \$f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\$ at \$x=0\$ is an infinite discontinuity.

---

#### (4) Oscillatory Discontinuity

* Definition: As \$x\to a\$, the function has no limit (i.e., oscillates infinitely).
* Feature: The function oscillates violently up and down within the neighborhood.
* Example: \$f(x)=\sin\frac{1}{x}\$ at \$x=0\$ is an oscillatory discontinuity.

## III. Properties of Continuous Functions

1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   If \$f,g\$ are continuous at \$a\$, then \$f\pm g,\ fg,\ f/g\ (g(a)\ne0)\$ are also continuous at \$a\$.

2. **Continuity of Composite Functions**
   If \$\lim\_{x\to a} g(x)=b\$, and \$f\$ is continuous at \$b\$, then the composite function \$f(g(x))\$ is continuous at \$x=a\$.

3. **Continuity of Elementary Functions**
   All elementary functions (power, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric) are continuous on their domains.

---

## IV. Important Properties of Continuous Functions on Intervals

1. **Boundedness Theorem**
   If a function is continuous on the closed interval $\[a,b]\$, then it must be bounded.

2. **Extreme Value Theorem**
   If a function is continuous on the closed interval $\[a,b]\$, then it must attain its maximum and minimum values.

3. **Intermediate Value Theorem**
   If a function is continuous on the closed interval $\[a,b]\$, and \$f(a)\ne f(b)\$, then for any value \$C\$ between \$f(a)\$ and \$f(b)\$, there exists \$x\_0\in(a,b)\$ such that \$f(x\_0)=C\$.

---

## V. Common Exam Points Summary

* Master the **definition of continuity** (limit equals function value).
* Be familiar with the **classification of discontinuities**, and analyze specific types via left and right limits.
* Remember that **elementary functions are continuous everywhere in their domains**.
* Apply the **boundedness, extreme value, and intermediate value theorems** to solve problems of determining values or existence of solutions.

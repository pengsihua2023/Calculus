# Concavity and Inflection Points of Functions

Main knowledge points of this section, divided into three parts: concavity â†’ second derivative test â†’ inflection points â†’ applications.

## I. Concavity of Functions

### 1. Definition

Suppose \$f(x)\$ is continuous on an interval \$I\$:

* If for any \$x\_1,x\_2 \in I\$, and \$0<\lambda<1\$, we have

$$
f(\lambda x_1+(1-\lambda)x_2) \le \lambda f(x_1)+(1-\lambda)f(x_2),
$$

then \$f(x)\$ is **convex (concave up, opening upward)** on \$I\$.

* If the inequality is reversed, then \$f(x)\$ is **concave (concave down, opening downward)**.

Here are **examples of curve convexity**:

* Left figure: ( f(x) = x^2 ), is a **convex function (convex upwards, opening upwards)**.
* Right figure: ( f(x) = -x^2 ), is a **concave function (concave downwards, opening downwards)**.

## II. Second Derivative Test

Suppose \$f(x)\$ is twice differentiable on the interval:

* If \$f''(x) > 0\$, the graph is **concave up**;
* If \$f''(x) < 0\$, the graph is **concave down**.

Note:

* If the second derivative equals zero, concavity cannot be determined directly â€” one must check the sign change on either side.

## III. Inflection Points

### 1. Definition

If \$f(x)\$ is continuous at some point \$x\_0\$, and the curve **changes concavity** at that point, then \$x\_0\$ is called an **inflection point**.

### 2. Determination Method

* First solve \$f''(x)=0\$ or points where \$f''(x)\$ does not exist to find candidate points;
* Then check whether the sign of \$f''(x)\$ changes on either side of the point:

  * \$+\to -\$: inflection point;
  * \$-\to +\$: inflection point.

### 3. Examples

* \$f(x)=x^3\$:

  * \$f''(x)=6x\$, which changes sign at \$x=0\$, so \$x=0\$ is an inflection point.
* \$f(x)=x^4\$:

  * \$f''(x)=12x^2 \ge 0\$, no sign change at \$x=0\$, so \$x=0\$ is **not** an inflection point.

## IV. Applications

1. **Graph Analysis**

   * Concavity helps determine the bending direction of the graph;
   * Inflection points are key turning points of the curveâ€™s shape.

2. **Optimization Problems**

   * Combining extrema with concavity analysis allows for a more precise understanding of function behavior.

3. **Applications in Economics**

   * Convex functions are often used to represent cost or risk functions;
   * Concave functions are often used for utility functions.

## V. Exam Summary

1. **Definition of concavity** (secant line criterion) and intuitive graph understanding.
2. **Second derivative test**: \$f''>0\$ â†’ concave up, \$f''<0\$ â†’ concave down.
3. **Inflection point test**: candidates must satisfy \$f''=0\$ or \$f''\$ undefined, and sign change is required.
4. **Typical examples**: \$x^3\$ has an inflection point, \$x^4\$ does not.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:

* **Concavity**: check the sign of \$f''\$.
* **Inflection point**: where the second derivative changes sign.

Four typical function graphs:

* **\$x^2\$**: second derivative \$f''(x)=2>0\$, always **concave up**.
* **\$-x^2\$**: second derivative \$f''(x)=-2<0\$, always **concave down**.
* **\$x^3\$**: second derivative \$f''(x)=6x\$, changes sign at \$x=0\$, so \$(0,0)\$ is an **inflection point**.
* **\$x^4\$**: second derivative \$f''(x)=12x^2 \ge 0\$, no sign change at \$x=0\$, so \$(0,0)\$ is not an inflection point.

ðŸ‘‰ These examples perfectly illustrate the typical cases of **concavity test** and **inflection point determination**.

Main knowledge points of this section, divided into three parts: monotonicity → determination of extrema → common applications.

## I. Monotonicity of Functions

### 1. Definition

* If on an interval \$I\$, for any \$x\_1\<x\_2\$, we have \$f(x\_1)\<f(x\_2)\$, then \$f\$ is **monotonically increasing**;

* If \$f(x\_1)>f(x\_2)\$, then \$f\$ is **monotonically decreasing**.

### 2. Relation to Derivatives

Suppose \$f(x)\$ is differentiable on interval \$I\$:

* If \$f'(x)>0\$, then \$f(x)\$ is monotonically increasing on \$I\$;
* If \$f'(x)<0\$, then \$f(x)\$ is monotonically decreasing on \$I\$;
* If \$f'(x)=0\$, further analysis is needed (it may be a stationary point or an inflection point).

### 3. Steps for Finding Monotonic Intervals

1. Compute the derivative \$f'(x)\$;
2. Solve for stationary points \$f'(x)=0\$ and non-differentiable points;
3. Determine the sign of \$f'(x)\$ in each subinterval;
4. Conclude the monotonicity of \$f(x)\$ on each interval.

## II. Extrema of Functions

### 1. Definition of Extrema

* If there exists a neighborhood \$U(x\_0)\$ such that for all \$x\in U(x\_0)\setminus{x\_0}\$:

  * \$f(x)\le f(x\_0)\$, then \$f(x\_0)\$ is a **local maximum**;
  * \$f(x)\ge f(x\_0)\$, then \$f(x\_0)\$ is a **local minimum**.

* Local maxima and minima are collectively called **extrema**.

### 2. Necessary Condition for Extrema

* If \$f(x)\$ has an extremum at \$x\_0\$ and is differentiable there, then

$$
f'(x_0)=0
$$

(i.e., extrema occur only at stationary points or non-differentiable points).

### 3. Tests for Extrema

#### (1) First Derivative Test

* If \$f'(x)>0\$ to the left of \$x\_0\$ and \$f'(x)<0\$ to the right, then \$f(x\_0)\$ is a local maximum;
* If \$f'(x)<0\$ to the left of \$x\_0\$ and \$f'(x)>0\$ to the right, then \$f(x\_0)\$ is a local minimum.

#### (2) Second Derivative Test

* If \$f'(x\_0)=0, f''(x\_0)>0\$, then \$f(x\_0)\$ is a local minimum;
* If \$f'(x\_0)=0, f''(x\_0)<0\$, then \$f(x\_0)\$ is a local maximum;
* If \$f'(x\_0)=0, f''(x\_0)=0\$, further analysis is needed (may be an inflection point).

#### An example

<img width="490" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c670c933-3f60-48a1-8b99-3db4cb4a808f" />

The figure above illustrates the extrema of the function

$$
f(x) = x^3 - 3x
$$

* At (x=-1), the function attains a local maximum, with value (f(-1)=2).
* At (x=1), the function attains a local minimum, with value (f(1)=-2).

### Explanation

1. First, take the derivative of the function:

$$
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3
$$

Solving the equation (f'(x)=0), we obtain the critical points (x=\pm 1).

2. Determine maximum or minimum:

   * (f''(x) = 6x).
   * At (x=-1), the second derivative (f''(-1) = -6 < 0), hence it is a local maximum.
   * At (x=1), the second derivative (f''(1) = 6 > 0), hence it is a local minimum.

Therefore, the two red points marked on the curve are the visual demonstration of the local maximum and minimum.

## III. Related Concepts

1. **Inflection Point**

   * A point where the concavity of the curve changes.
   * If \$f''(x\_0)=0\$ and the sign of \$f''\$ changes across \$x\_0\$, then \$x\_0\$ is an inflection point.

2. **Absolute Maximum/Minimum (Global Extrema)**

   * Defined as the largest/smallest value of \$f\$ over the entire interval, different from local extrema.
   * The absolute extremum must occur either at a local extremum or at a boundary point.

## IV. Common Applications

1. **Monotonicity Analysis**

   * Used to determine the increasing/decreasing trend of a function, essential for graph sketching.

2. **Finding Extreme Points**

   * Solving optimization problems, such as maximum area, minimum distance, etc.

3. **Curve Sketching**

   * Monotonic intervals + extreme points + inflection points → determine the general shape of the curve.

## V. Exam Summary

1. **Monotonicity**: judged by the sign of \$f'(x)\$.
2. **Necessary condition for extrema**: stationary points (\$f'(x)=0\$) or non-differentiable points.
3. **Tests for extrema**: first derivative test (sign changes), second derivative test.
4. **Distinguish extrema and absolute extrema**: extrema are local, absolute extrema are global.
5. **Applications**: optimization problems, curve sketching.

📌 **One-Sentence Summary**:
“Monotonicity and Extrema” mainly use the **first derivative to determine increasing/decreasing behavior**, and the **first/second derivative tests to determine extrema**, while linking to inflection points and absolute extrema. It is a core tool in function analysis and applied problems.

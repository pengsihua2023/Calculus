## I. Idea of Approximate Calculation

1. **Basic Starting Point**

* When \$\Delta x\$ is very small, the function increment can be approximated by the differential:

$$
f(x+\Delta x) \approx f(x) + f'(x)\Delta x
$$

2. **Higher-Order Approximation**

* By introducing higher-order derivatives, we can obtain more accurate approximations: this is the idea of the **Taylor expansion**.

## II. Taylor Formula

### 1. General Form

If \$f(x)\$ has derivatives up to order \$n+1\$ at \$x\_0\$, then

$$
f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n + R_n(x)
$$

where \$R\_n(x)\$ is the remainder term.

### 2. Remainder Term

Commonly used **Lagrange form of the remainder**:

$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}, \quad \xi \text{ lies between } x \text{ and } x_0
$$

## III. Maclaurin Formula

A special case of Taylor formula at \$x\_0=0\$:

$$
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n + R_n(x)
$$

## IV. Common Expansions (as \$x\to 0\$)

1. Exponential Function

$$
e^x = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\cdots
$$

2. Trigonometric Functions

$$
\sin x = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = 1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\cdots
$$

3. Logarithmic Function

$$
\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \quad (|x|<1)
$$

4. Rational Function

$$
\frac{1}{1-x} = 1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots \quad (|x|<1)
$$

## V. Applications

1. **Approximate Calculation**

* When \$x\$ is very small, use the first few terms to approximate the function value.
* Example: \$\sin 0.01 \approx 0.01\$.

2. **Limit Evaluation**

* Often used for indeterminate forms by expansion to extract the leading term.
* Example: \$\lim\_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \frac{x^2/2}{x^2}=\tfrac12\$.

3. **Error Estimation**

* Use the remainder \$R\_n(x)\$ to control approximation error.

## VI. Notes

1. Not all functions can be expanded into power series — smoothness conditions are required.
2. The expansion’s interval of convergence is limited; beyond it, the series is invalid.
3. In practice, only the first few terms are kept, ignoring higher-order small terms.

## VII. Exam Summary

1. **General Taylor formula**, especially the remainder expression.
2. **Maclaurin formula** and common expansions.
3. **Applications**: approximation and limit evaluation.
4. **Error control**: estimate using the remainder.
5. Distinguish between “exact expansion” (with remainder) and “approximate expansion” (ignoring higher-order terms).

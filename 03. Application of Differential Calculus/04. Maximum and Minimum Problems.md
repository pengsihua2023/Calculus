## I. Concept of Maximum and Minimum

1. **Maximum / Minimum**

* If on an interval \$D\$, there exists \$x\_0\in D\$ such that

$$
f(x_0)\ge f(x),\ \forall x\in D
$$

then \$f(x\_0)\$ is the **maximum**;

$$
f(x_0)\le f(x),\ \forall x\in D
$$

then \$f(x\_0)\$ is the **minimum**.

2. **Difference between Local Extrema and Global Max/Min**

* **Extrema**: local, emphasized near a point;
* **Max/Min**: global, emphasized over the entire interval.

3. **An example**

This figure illustrates the concepts of **local extrema** and **global extrema**:

* ðŸ”´ **Red points (Local Extrema):**

  * Local maximum: ((-1, 2))
  * Local minimum: ((1, -2))

* ðŸ”µ **Blue points (Global Extrema, on the interval ([-3,3])):**

  * Global maximum: ((-3, 18))
  * Global minimum: ((3, -18))

Thus it can be seen intuitively that:

* **Local extrema** are the highest or lowest points in the neighborhood (peaks/valleys).
* **Global extrema** are the highest or lowest points over the entire interval.

## II. General Steps for Finding Max and Min

1. **Determine the domain**: based on problem conditions (closed interval, open interval, constraints).
2. **Find critical points**: solve \$f'(x)=0\$ to get candidate points.
3. **Consider non-differentiable points**: if the function is not differentiable at certain points, those may also be extrema.
4. **Substitute boundary points**: in a closed interval, endpoints are also candidates for max/min.
5. **Compare function values**: evaluate all candidates and compare; the largest is the maximum, the smallest is the minimum.

## III. Common Types

### 1. Max/Min on Closed Intervals

* Theorem: A continuous function on a closed interval must attain a maximum and a minimum.
* Method: compare values at critical points + endpoints.

### 2. Max/Min on Unbounded Intervals

* Need to evaluate \$\lim\_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x)\$ along with critical points.

### 3. Max/Min with Constraints

* Common in geometry problems (maximum area, shortest distance, etc.).
* Method: eliminate variables using constraints, reduce to a single-variable function, then find extrema with derivatives.

### 4. Max/Min of Multivariable Functions (Simple Cases)

* If two variables are involved, use **Lagrange multipliers** or substitution/elimination methods.

## IV. Typical Examples

1. **Function on an Interval**

   * Example: \$f(x)=x^3-3x\$ on $\[-2,2]\$:

     * \$f'(x)=3x^2-3=3(x^2-1)=0 \Rightarrow x=\pm 1\$
     * Substitute \$x=-2,-1,1,2\$, compare function values, and determine maximum and minimum.

2. **Geometric Application Problem**

   * Example: In a rectangle with fixed perimeter, prove that the area is maximized when the rectangle is a square.

#### (1). Condition Setup

Let the length of the rectangle be (a), and the width be (b).
The perimeter is fixed as (P), then

$$
2a + 2b = P \quad \Rightarrow \quad a + b = \frac{P}{2}.
$$

#### (2). Express the Area

The area is:

$$
S = ab.
$$

Since (b = \frac{P}{2} - a), substitute into the formula:

$$
S(a) = a\left(\frac{P}{2} - a\right) = \frac{P}{2}a - a^2.
$$

#### (3). Find the Maximum

This is a quadratic function with respect to (a):

$$
S(a) = -a^2 + \frac{P}{2}a.
$$

It opens downward, and the maximum occurs at the vertex:

$$
a = \frac{-\frac{P}{2}}{2(-1)} = \frac{P}{4}.
$$

Thus,

$$
b = \frac{P}{2} - a = \frac{P}{4}.
$$

#### (4). Conclusion

Therefore, when the length equals the width, i.e. (a=b=\frac{P}{4}), the area is maximized.
At this point, the rectangle is a square.

âœ… **Conclusion**: In a rectangle with fixed perimeter, the area is maximized when the rectangle is a square.

## V. Notes

1. Always check endpoints â€” often the extrema occur at endpoints.
2. Non-differentiable points cannot be ignored.
3. If the domain is unbounded, limits must be considered.
4. Extrema \$\neq\$ global max/min; global comparison is required.

---

## VI. Exam Summary

1. **Extrema vs Max/Min**: local vs global.
2. **Methods**: critical points (\$f'(x)=0\$), non-differentiable points, endpoints.
3. **Closed Interval Theorem**: a continuous function on a closed interval always has max/min.
4. **Applications**: geometric optimization problems, physics optimization problems.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:
The core idea of max/min problems is: **critical points + non-differentiable points + endpoints + limits â†’ global comparison â†’ final max/min**.

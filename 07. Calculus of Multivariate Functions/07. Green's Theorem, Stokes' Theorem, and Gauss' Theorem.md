## I. Green‚Äôs Theorem

1. **Formula**
   Let \$D\$ be a smooth, simply connected plane region, and let the boundary curve \$L=\partial D\$ be oriented positively (counterclockwise):

$$
\oint_L P\,dx+Q\,dy = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dxdy
$$

2. **Conditions**

* \$P,Q\$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives in \$D\$;
* Region \$D\$ is simply connected with a piecewise smooth boundary.

3. **Meaning**

* **Geometric meaning**: Correspondence between circulation and the area integral of curl;
* **Physical meaning**: Circulation of a 2D fluid field, area flux.

## II. Stokes‚Äô Theorem

1. **Formula**
   Let \$\Sigma\$ be a smooth oriented surface in space with boundary curve \$L=\partial\Sigma\$, then

$$
\oint_L \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r} = \iint_\Sigma (\nabla\times \vec{F}) \cdot d\vec{S}
$$

2. **Conditions**

* The vector field \$\vec{F}=(P,Q,R)\$ has continuous partial derivatives near the surface;
* The surface is smooth, boundary closed, with orientation satisfying the right-hand rule.

3. **Meaning**

* **Geometric meaning**: Correspondence between line circulation and flux of curl;
* **Physical meaning**: Curl theorem in electromagnetism, fluid circulation.

## III. Gauss‚Äô Divergence Theorem

1. **Formula**
   Let \$\Omega\$ be a bounded closed region in space with boundary surface \$\Sigma=\partial \Omega\$ oriented outward:

$$
\iint_\Sigma \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{S} = \iiint_\Omega \nabla\cdot \vec{F}\, dV
$$

2. **Conditions**

* The vector field \$\vec{F}\$ has continuous partial derivatives in the region;
* The region has a piecewise smooth closed boundary.

3. **Meaning**

* **Geometric meaning**: Correspondence between flux and the volume integral of divergence;
* **Physical meaning**: Fluid continuity, law of conservation of charge.

## IV. Relationships among the Three

1. **Green‚Äôs theorem = A 2D special case of Stokes‚Äô theorem**

* The boundary curve of a plane region corresponds to the 2D version of Stokes‚Äô theorem.

2. **Stokes‚Äô theorem and Gauss‚Äô theorem as counterparts**

* Stokes‚Äô theorem involves **curl** and surface boundary curves;
* Gauss‚Äô theorem involves **divergence** and the volume enclosed by a surface.

3. **Overall connections**

## V. Key Points Summary

1. **Green‚Äôs theorem**

   * Applicable to 2D plane regions;
   * Converts plane circulation integrals into area integrals.

2. **Stokes‚Äô theorem**

   * Converts flux integrals into volume integrals.

4. **Core idea**

   * Integral transformations: line ‚Üî surface ‚Üî volume;
   * Closely related to curl and divergence;
   * In physics corresponds to **conservation laws** (flux conservation, circulation conservation).

üìå **One-Sentence Summary**:
**Green‚Äôs theorem, Stokes‚Äô theorem, and Gauss‚Äô theorem** are bridges between line, surface, and volume integrals. Their core idea is the connection between **local differential operations (curl/divergence)** and **global integral quantities (circulation/flux)**, embodying the ‚Äúlocal‚Äìglobal‚Äù unity of conservation laws.

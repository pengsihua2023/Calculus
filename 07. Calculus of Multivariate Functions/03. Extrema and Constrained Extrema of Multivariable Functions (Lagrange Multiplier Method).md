## I. Unconstrained Extrema of Multivariable Functions

1. **Definition**
   Suppose the function \$f(x,y)\$ is defined in a neighborhood of \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$:

* If \$\exists U\$ such that for any \$(x,y)\in U\$ we have

$$
f(x,y)\le f(x_0,y_0),
$$

then \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$ is a maximum point.

* If

$$
f(x,y)\ge f(x_0,y_0),
$$

then it is a minimum point.

2. **Necessary Condition**
   If \$f(x,y)\$ is differentiable at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$ and has an extremum, then it must satisfy

$$
f_x(x_0,y_0) = 0, \quad f_y(x_0,y_0)=0
$$

that is, the **stationary point** condition.

## II. Test for Extrema of Two-Variable Functions (Hessian Test)

1. **Second Derivative Discriminant**
   Let

$$
D = f_{xx}(x_0,y_0) f_{yy}(x_0,y_0) - [f_{xy}(x_0,y_0)]^2
$$

* If \$D>0, f\_{xx}>0\$: minimum.
* If \$D>0, f\_{xx}<0\$: maximum.
* If \$D<0\$: saddle point (neither maximum nor minimum).
* If \$D=0\$: inconclusive, further analysis required.

## III. Constrained Extrema

1. **Problem Formulation**
   Find extrema of \$f(x,y)\$ subject to the constraint

$$
g(x,y)=0
$$

2. **Geometric Meaning**
   This is to find extrema of the function restricted to the constraint curve/surface.

## IV. Lagrange Multipliers

1. **Basic Idea**
   Under the constraint \$g(x,y)=0\$, construct the **Lagrangian**:

$$
L(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) + \lambda g(x,y)
$$

2. **Conditions for Solution**
   Solve the system of equations:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0,\quad 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 0,\quad 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0
$$

to obtain candidate extremum points.

3. **Generalization**
   If there are multiple constraints:

$$
g_1(x,y,z)=0,\ g_2(x,y,z)=0, \dots
$$

then

$$
L=f+\lambda_1 g_1+\lambda_2 g_2+\cdots
$$

## V. Typical Examples

1. **Unconstrained Extrema**
   \$f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\$ has a minimum at \$(0,0)\$, value 0.

2. **Constrained Extrema**
   For constraint \$x+y=1\$, find extrema of \$f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\$:

* Construct \$L=x^2+y^2+\lambda(x+y-1)\$
* Solve the system:

$$
2x+\lambda=0,\quad 2y+\lambda=0,\quad x+y=1
$$

We get \$x=y=\tfrac{1}{2}\$, minimum value \$\tfrac{1}{2}\$.

## VI. Key Points Summary

1. **Unconstrained Extrema**

   * Stationary point condition: \$\nabla f=0\$
   * Hessian test (second derivative test).

2. **Constrained Extrema**

   * Problem form: extrema under constraints.
   * Method: Lagrange multipliers.

3. **Generalization**

   * Multiple constraints â†’ multiple Lagrange multipliers.

4. **Geometric Meaning**

   * At extrema, the gradient \$\nabla f\$ is parallel to the normal vector of the constraint.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:
Extrema problems of multivariable functions are divided into **unconstrained (Hessian test)** and **constrained (Lagrange multipliers)**. The essence is to use partial derivatives and gradient conditions to find optimal values of functions.

This figure illustrates the **geometric meaning of Lagrange multipliers**:

* Colored curves: level curves of \$f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\$ (circles).
* Green line: constraint \$x+y=1\$.
* Red point \$(0.5,0.5)\$: the point on the constraint line where \$f(x,y)\$ attains its minimum.
* Red arrow: gradient direction \$\nabla f = (2x,2y)\$, parallel to the normal vector of the constraint line.

ðŸ‘‰ This shows that at an extremum, the **level curve of the objective function is tangent to the constraint curve**, i.e.

$$
\nabla f \parallel \nabla g
$$

## I. Definition of Total Differential

For a two-variable function \$z=f(x,y)\$ at the point \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$:

$$
\Delta z = f(x_0+\Delta x,y_0+\Delta y)-f(x_0,y_0)
$$

If there exist constants \$A, B\$ such that

$$
\Delta z = A\Delta x + B\Delta y + o(\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}), \quad (\Delta x,\Delta y)\to(0,0)
$$

then the function is said to be **differentiable** at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$, and

$$
dz = A\,dx + B\,dy
$$

is called the **total differential**.

## II. Differentiability and Relation with Partial Derivatives

1. **Necessary Condition**
   If a function is differentiable at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$, then partial derivatives must exist, and

$$
dz = f_x(x_0,y_0)\,dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)\,dy
$$

2. **Sufficient Condition**
   If partial derivatives exist at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$ and are **continuous** at that point, then the function is differentiable at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$.

3. **Differentiability Implies Continuity**
   If a function is differentiable at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$, then it must be continuous at that point.
   But the converse is not true: continuity does not necessarily imply differentiability.

## III. Geometric Meaning

1. **Tangent Plane**
   The total differential gives the equation of the tangent plane of the surface \$z=f(x,y)\$ at \$(x\_0,y\_0,f(x\_0,y\_0))\$:

$$
z-z_0 = f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)
$$

2. **Approximation Formula**

$$
\Delta z \approx f_x(x_0,y_0)\Delta x + f_y(x_0,y_0)\Delta y
$$

Used for approximation and error estimation of multivariable functions.

## IV. Extension to Multivariable Functions

For a three-variable function \$u=f(x,y,z)\$, if differentiable, then

$$
du = f_x dx + f_y dy + f_z dz
$$

More generally, for an \$n\$-variable function:

$$
df = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} dx_i
$$

2. **Error Analysis**: propagation law of measurement errors.
3. **Tangent Plane and Normal Vector**: geometric study of surfaces.
4. **Foundation for Further Theory**: directional derivative, gradient, multivariable extrema, constrained extrema.

## VI. Key Points Summary

1. **Definition of Total Differential**: \$\Delta z = A\Delta x+B\Delta y+o(\rho)\$.

2. **Conditions for Differentiability**: existence and continuity of partial derivatives â‡’ differentiable.

3. **Logical Chain**:

   * Differentiable â‡’ Continuous;
   * Existence of partial derivatives â‰  Differentiable;
   * Existence and continuity of partial derivatives â‡’ Differentiable.

4. **Formulas**:

$$
dz = f_x dx + f_y dy \quad (\text{two variables})
$$

$$
du = f_x dx + f_y dy + f_z dz \quad (\text{three variables})

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:
The **total differential** is the linear approximation of changes in a multivariable function. **Differentiability = existence of total differential**. Geometrically, it corresponds to the tangent plane, forming a fundamental cornerstone of multivariable calculus.

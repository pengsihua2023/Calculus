## I. Definition of Multivariable Functions

1. **Two-Variable Function**
   If variables \$x,y\$ in some domain \$D\$ correspond to a real number \$z\$ for every ordered pair \$(x,y)\$, then \$z=f(x,y)\$ is called a two-variable function.

2. **Geometric Meaning**
   The graph of a two-variable function is a **surface in space**:

$$
z=f(x,y)
$$

3. **Common Representations**

* Explicit function: \$z=f(x,y)\$
* Implicit function: \$F(x,y,z)=0\$
* Parametric equations:

## II. Concept of Partial Derivatives

1. **Definition**
   For a two-variable function \$z=f(x,y)\$, fix one variable and let the other vary:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x_0+\Delta x,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\Delta x}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0) = \lim_{\Delta y \to 0}\frac{f(x_0,y_0+\Delta y)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\Delta y}
$$

2. **Notation**

$$
f_x=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\quad f_y=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

## III. Higher-Order Partial Derivatives

1. **Second-Order Partial Derivatives**

$$
f_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2},\quad f_{yy} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2},\quad f_{xy} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x},\quad f_{yx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}
$$

2. **Equality of Mixed Partial Derivatives Theorem**
   If \$f(x,y)\$ has continuous second-order partial derivatives in some neighborhood, then

$$
f_{xy} = f_{yx}
$$

## IV. Relation Between Total Differential and Partial Derivatives

1. **Definition of Total Differential**
   If \$z=f(x,y)\$ is differentiable at \$(x\_0,y\_0)\$, then

$$
dz = f_x(x_0,y_0)\,dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)\,dy
$$

2. **Geometric Meaning**
   The total differential represents the **equation of the tangent plane** to the surface at the point \$(x\_0,y\_0,f(x\_0,y\_0))\$:

$$
z-z_0 = f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)
$$

## V. Geometric Meaning and Applications

1. **Geometric Meaning of Partial Derivatives**

* \$f\_x\$: slope of the surface along the \$x\$ direction;
* \$f\_y\$: slope of the surface along the \$y\$ direction.

2. **Applications of Total Differential**

* Approximate calculation:

$$
\Delta z \approx f_x\Delta x + f_y\Delta y
$$

* Error analysis: use partial derivatives to estimate small changes in multivariable functions.

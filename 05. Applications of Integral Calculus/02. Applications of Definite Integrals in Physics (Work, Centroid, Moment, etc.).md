# Applications of Definite Integrals in Physics (Work, Center of Mass, Moment, etc.)

The main knowledge points in this section are divided into four parts: **Work, Center of Mass, Moment of Force/Moment of Inertia, and Other Applications**.

## I. Work

1. **Formula for Work by a Variable Force**
   If an object moves along a straight line under a force that is a function of position \$F(x)\$, with displacement interval $\[a,b]\$, then the work is:

$$
W = \int_a^b F(x)\,dx
$$

2. **Examples**

* Spring extension: Hooke‚Äôs law \$F(x)=kx\$,

$$
W=\int_0^d kx\,dx = \frac{1}{2}kd^2
$$

* Gravitational force (radial):

$$
W = \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{GMm}{r^2}\,dr
$$

## II. Center of Mass

1. **1D Center of Mass (Linear Density)**
   For a homogeneous thin rod with density \$\rho(x)\$, the total mass is:

$$
M = \int_a^b \rho(x)\,dx
$$

Center of mass position:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{M}\int_a^b x\rho(x)\,dx
$$

2. **2D Center of Mass (Planar Region)**
   For a region \$D\$ with density \$\rho(x,y)\$, the total mass is:

$$
M = \iint_D \rho(x,y)\,dA
$$

Coordinates of the center of mass:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{M}\iint_D x\rho(x,y)\,dA, 
\quad \bar{y} = \frac{1}{M}\iint_D y\rho(x,y)\,dA
$$

## III. Moment and Moment of Inertia

1. **Moment of Force**
   The moment of force about a point \$O\$ is:

$$
M = \int r F\,dx
$$

Or more generally:

$$
M = \iint_D r \cdot \rho(x,y)\,dA
$$

2. **Moment of Inertia**
   For a mass distribution region \$D\$ with density \$\rho(x,y)\$, and distance from the rotation axis to point \$(x,y)\$ being \$r\$, the moment of inertia is:

$$
I = \iint_D r^2 \rho(x,y)\,dA
$$

* For a rotating body:

  $$
  I = \int r^2\,dm
  $$

  where \$r\$ is the distance to the axis of rotation.

## IV. Other Physical Applications

1. **Arc Length and Element Mass**
   If a curve has arc length density \$\lambda(s)\$, the total mass is:

$$
M = \int \lambda(s)\,ds
$$

2. **Electrostatics/Gravitational Field**

* Linear charge/mass distribution: field strength by integration.
* Surface charge/mass distribution: double integral.

## V. Summary of Key Points

1. **Work**: \$\int F(x),dx\$, formula for work by a variable force.
2. **Center of Mass**: The ‚Äúweighted average position‚Äù of the total mass distribution.

   * 1D: \$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{M}\int x\rho(x)dx\$
   * 2D: \$(\bar{x},\bar{y})=\frac{1}{M}\iint (x,y)\rho dA\$
3. **Moment of Force**: Integral of force √ó distance.
4. **Moment of Inertia**: \$\int r^2 dm\$, describes the difficulty of rotation.
5. **Essence**: In physics, definite integrals decompose physical quantities into infinitesimal elements and then sum them up.

---

üìå **One-Sentence Summary**:
In physics, definite integrals are often used to convert **continuously distributed physical quantities (force, mass, density)** into additive ‚Äúelemental quantities,‚Äù and then obtain total work, center of mass, moment, and moment of inertia through integration.

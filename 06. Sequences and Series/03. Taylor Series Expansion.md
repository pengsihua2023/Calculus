## I. Definition and Formula of Taylor Series

1. **Taylor Formula**
   Suppose the function \$f(x)\$ has derivatives of all orders near the point \$x\_0\$, then its **Taylor expansion** is:

$$
f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n + R_n(x)
$$

2. **Taylor Series**
   If the remainder \$R\_n(x)\to 0\$ as \$n\to\infty\$, it can be written as an infinite series:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n
$$

## II. Maclaurin Series (Taylor Series at \$x\_0=0\$)

When the center of expansion is \$x\_0=0\$:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

## III. Common Maclaurin Expansions

1. **Exponential Function**

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!},\quad R=+\infty
$$

2. **Trigonometric Functions**

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!},\quad R=+\infty
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!},\quad R=+\infty
$$

3. **Logarithmic Function**

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}\frac{x^n}{n},\quad |x|<1
$$

4. **Rational Function**

$$
\frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n,\quad |x|<1
$$

## IV. Convergence and Remainder

1. **Radius of Convergence**
   Determined using the ratio test or root test to find \$R\$.

2. **Form of the Remainder (Lagrange Form)**

$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}, \quad \xi \text{ lies between } x \text{ and } x_0
$$

3. **Uniform Convergence and Term-by-Term Operations**
   Within the interval of convergence, the Taylor series can be differentiated and integrated term by term.

## V. Applications

1. **Approximation**
   Use the first few terms to approximate the function, with the remainder estimating the error.
   Example: \$\sin x \approx x - \frac{x^3}{6}\$, error \$O(x^5)\$.

2. **Limit Evaluation**
   Use expansions to handle \$0/0\$ forms or complicated limits.
   Example:
   \$\lim\_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}\$.

3. **Function Analysis**
   Expansions reveal local properties of functions such as smoothness and parity.

## VI. Key Points Summary

1. **Taylor Expansion Formula**: finite expansion + remainder.
2. **Maclaurin Series**: the special case with center at \$0\$.
3. **Common Expansions**: \$e^x,\ \sin x,\ \cos x,\ \ln(1+x),\ (1-x)^{-1}\$.
4. **Convergence**: radius \$R\$, endpoints need separate testing.
5. **Applications**: approximation, limits, error estimation.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:
Taylor series approximate a function near a point by a polynomial. The core is the **expansion formula, common expansions, radius of convergence, and remainder**, which are extremely important for approximation and limit evaluation.

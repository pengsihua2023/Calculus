## I. Basic Idea of Fourier Series

1. **Goal**: Represent a periodic function \$f(x)\$ on the interval $\[-L,L]\$ as an **infinite series of sines and cosines**:

$$
f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Big[a_n \cos\frac{n\pi x}{L} + b_n \sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}\Big]
$$

2. **Essential Idea**: Use sine and cosine functions as ‚Äúbasis functions‚Äù to perform a ‚Äúfrequency decomposition‚Äù of the function.

## II. Formulas for Fourier Coefficients

If \$f(x)\$ is integrable on $\[-L,L]\$, then the Fourier coefficients are:

* Constant term:

$$
a_0 = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\,dx
$$

* Cosine term coefficients:

$$
a_n = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\cos\frac{n\pi x}{L}\,dx, \quad n\ge 1
$$

* Sine term coefficients:

$$
b_n = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}\,dx, \quad n\ge 1
$$

## III. Special Cases: Expansions of Even and Odd Functions

1. **Even Function (symmetric about the y-axis)**

   * \$b\_n=0\$, only cosine terms remain (cosine expansion).

2. **Odd Function (symmetric about the origin)**

   * \$a\_n=0, a\_0=0\$, only sine terms remain (sine expansion).

üëâ This is an important technique for simplifying calculations.

## IV. Convergence of Fourier Series

1. **Dirichlet‚Äôs Theorem** (sufficient condition)

   * If \$f(x)\$ is piecewise continuous and piecewise smooth on $\[-L,L]\$, then its Fourier series converges in the interval to:

     * At a point of continuity: converges to \$f(x)\$;
     * At a point of discontinuity: converges to the average of the left and right limits.

2. **Gibbs Phenomenon**

   * Near a jump discontinuity, partial sums exhibit overshoot, but the limit value is still the average of the left and right limits.

## V. Common Applications

1. **Representation of Periodic Functions**

   * Expand any periodic function into sine and cosine form.

2. **Periodic Extension of Non-Periodic Functions**

   * Extend a function defined on $\[0,L]\$ or $\[-L,L]\$ to a periodic function, then expand.

3. **Physics and Engineering**

   * Solutions of the heat equation and wave equation.
   * Frequency analysis in signal processing.

## VI. Key Points Summary

1. **General Form**:

$$
f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \big[a_n \cos(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L}) + b_n \sin(\tfrac{n\pi x}{L})\big]
$$

2. **Coefficient Formulas**:

$$
a_0=\frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)dx,\quad 
a_n=\frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\cos\frac{n\pi x}{L}dx,\quad
b_n=\frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}dx
$$

3. **Simplifications for Even/Odd Functions**:
   Even function ‚Üí cosine series; odd function ‚Üí sine series.

4. **Convergence**: At points of continuity, converges to the function value; at points of discontinuity, converges to the average of left and right limits.

5. **Applications**: Expansion of periodic functions, solving PDEs, frequency spectrum analysis in signals.

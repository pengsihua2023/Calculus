## I. Definition of Power Series

General form:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x-x_0)^n
$$

where:

* \$a\_n\$ are coefficients;
* \$x\_0\$ is the center of expansion.
  A power series is an infinite series in the variable \$(x-x\_0)\$.

## II. Radius and Interval of Convergence

## 1. Radius of Convergence

There always exists a nonnegative number \$R\$ such that:

* When \$|x-x\_0| < R\$, the series converges absolutely;
* When \$|x-x\_0| > R\$, the series diverges;
* When \$|x-x\_0| = R\$, the convergence must be determined separately.

This \$R\$ is called the **radius of convergence**, and the interval \$(x\_0-R, x\_0+R)\$ is called the **interval of convergence**.

## 2. Formula for the Radius of Convergence

Two commonly used tests:

* **Ratio Test**:

$$
R = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left| \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} \right|
$$

* **Root Test**:

$$
R = \frac{1}{\limsup_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}}
$$

## III. Properties of Convergence

1. Inside the interval of convergence: the power series **converges absolutely** and can be differentiated and integrated term by term.

   * Derivative:

$$
\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-x_0)^n\right)' = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n (x-x_0)^{n-1}
$$

* Integral:

$$
\int \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-x_0)^n dx = C+\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n+1}(x-x_0)^{n+1}
$$

* The interval of convergence remains unchanged.

2. At the endpoints of the interval of convergence: the convergence must be **tested separately**.

## IV. Typical Examples

1. **Geometric Series**

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{1}{1-x},\quad |x|<1
$$

Radius of convergence \$R=1\$, interval of convergence \$(-1,1)\$, endpoints need to be checked separately.

2. **Expansion of the Exponential Function**

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}, \quad R=+\infty
$$

3. **Expansion of Sine and Cosine**

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!},\quad R=+\infty
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!},\quad R=+\infty
$$

4. **Expansion of the Logarithmic Function**

$$
\ln(1+x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1}\frac{x^n}{n}, \quad |x|<1
$$

Radius of convergence \$R=1\$, at the endpoints:

* At \$x=1\$: convergent (alternating harmonic series);
* At \$x=-1\$: divergent.

## V. Key Points Summary

1. **Definition of Power Series**: \$\sum a\_n(x-x\_0)^n\$.
2. **Radius of Convergence \$R\$**: ratio/root test formulas.
3. **Interval of Convergence**: endpoints must be checked separately.
4. **Properties**: inside the interval, term-by-term differentiation and integration are valid; the interval remains unchanged.
5. **Typical Expansions**: geometric series, exponential function, trigonometric functions, logarithmic function.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:
The core of power series is the **radius \$R\$ and interval of convergence**. Inside the interval, the series has good properties (absolute convergence, term-by-term operations), while the endpoints must be checked separately.

## I. Concept of Indefinite Integrals

1. **Antiderivative**
   If a function \$F(x)\$ is differentiable on interval \$I\$, and

$$
F'(x) = f(x), \quad \forall x \in I
$$

then \$F(x)\$ is called an antiderivative of \$f(x)\$.

2. **Indefinite Integral**
   The set of all antiderivatives of \$f(x)\$ is called the **indefinite integral**, denoted as:

$$
\int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + C
$$

where \$C\$ is the constant of integration.

## II. Properties of Indefinite Integrals

1. Linearity

$$
\int \big(f(x) \pm g(x)\big)\,dx = \int f(x)\,dx \pm \int g(x)\,dx
$$

$$
\int c f(x)\,dx = c\int f(x)\,dx
$$

2. Reverse Derivative Idea

* Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation.
* The essence of finding an indefinite integral is ‚Äúfinding the antiderivative.‚Äù

## III. Basic Integral Formulas

### 1. Power Functions

$$
\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C,\quad (n\ne -1)
$$

### 2. Exponential Functions

$$
\int e^x dx = e^x + C, \quad \int a^x dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln a}+C
$$

### 3. Logarithmic Functions

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C
$$

### 4. Trigonometric Functions

$$
\int \sin x dx = -\cos x + C, \quad \int \cos x dx = \sin x + C
$$

$$
\int \sec^2 x dx = \tan x + C, \quad \int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x + C
$$

$$
\int \sec x \tan x dx = \sec x + C, \quad \int \csc x \cot x dx = -\csc x + C
$$

### 5. Inverse Trigonometric Functions

$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = \arcsin x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \arctan x + C
$$

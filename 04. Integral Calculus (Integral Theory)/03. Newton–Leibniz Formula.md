# Newton‚ÄìLeibniz Formula

The main knowledge point of this section. It is the bridge in calculus that connects **differential calculus (derivatives)** and **integral calculus (definite integrals)**.

## I. Formula Content

Let function \$f(x)\$ be continuous on the closed interval $\[a,b]\$, and let \$F(x)\$ be an antiderivative of it, then

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).
$$

This is the **Newton‚ÄìLeibniz Formula**.

## II. Significance of the Formula

1. **Relationship between definite integrals and antiderivatives**

   * The calculation of definite integrals can be completed through antiderivatives.
   * The value of a definite integral depends only on the **endpoints** \$a,b\$, and not on the intermediate process.

2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**

   * Integration and differentiation are inverse operations:

     * An antiderivative is the result of integration;
     * A definite integral can be obtained using the antiderivative.

## III. Corollaries of the Formula

1. **Integral with upper limit function**
   Definition:

$$
\Phi(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt
$$

If \$f(x)\$ is continuous on $\[a,b]\$, then \$\Phi(x)\$ is differentiable on $\[a,b]\$, and

$$
\Phi'(x) = f(x).
$$

üëâ That is, ‚Äúthe derivative of the integral equals the integrand.‚Äù

2. **Substitution formula for definite integrals**
   If \$x=\varphi(t)\$ is continuous and differentiable, with \$\varphi(\alpha)=a, \varphi(\beta)=b\$, then

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_\alpha^\beta f(\varphi(t))\varphi'(t)\,dt.
$$

3. **Integration by parts (definite integral form)**

$$
\int_a^b u\,dv = \big[uv\big]_a^b - \int_a^b v\,du.
$$

## IV. Application Examples

1. **Direct computation of a definite integral**

$$
\int_0^1 (3x^2+2)\,dx = \Big[x^3+2x\Big]_0^1 = (1+2)-(0+0)=3.
$$

2. **Proof of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals**
   A continuous function on an interval must take some point \$\xi\$ such that

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = f(\xi)(b-a).
$$

3. **Applications in Physics**

   * Displacement \$s(t) = \int\_{t\_0}^{t\_1} v(t),dt\$, i.e., the integral of the velocity function = displacement increment.
   * Area calculation: \$\int\_a^b f(x),dx\$.

## V. Exam Summary

1. **Newton‚ÄìLeibniz Formula**: \$\int\_a^b f(x),dx=F(b)-F(a)\$.
2. **Relationship between integration and differentiation**: Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation.
3. **Property of integral with variable upper limit**: \$\dfrac{d}{dx}\int\_a^x f(t),dt=f(x)\$.
4. **Substitution formula and integration by parts**: Two important extensions of the formula.
5. **Applications**: Definite integral computation, mean value theorem for integrals, problems in physics and geometry.

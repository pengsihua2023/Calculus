## I. Definition of Definite Integrals

1. **Interval and Function Conditions**
   Let function \$f(x)\$ be bounded on the interval $\[a,b]\$. Divide $\[a,b]\$ into several subintervals:

$$
a=x_0<x_1<\cdots<x_n=b
$$

Take sample points \$\xi\_i \in \[x\_{i-1},x\_i]\$, and construct the sum:

$$
S=\sum_{i=1}^n f(\xi_i)\Delta x_i, \quad \Delta x_i = x_i-x_{i-1}
$$

If, when the **maximum subinterval length \$\lambda \to 0\$**, the limit of \$S\$ exists and is independent of the way of partitioning and choosing points, then this limit is called the definite integral of \$f(x)\$ on $\[a,b]\$:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{\lambda\to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n f(\xi_i)\Delta x_i
$$

## II. Existence of Definite Integrals

1. **Bounded + Monotonic function** is integrable on a closed interval;
2. **Bounded + Piecewise continuous function** is always integrable on a closed interval (the most commonly used sufficient condition);
3. Continuous functions on a closed interval are always integrable.

## III. Geometric Meaning of Definite Integrals

1. If \$f(x)\ge 0\$, then

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx
$$

represents the area of the region enclosed by the curve \$y=f(x)\$, the x-axis, and the lines \$x=a, x=b\$.

2. If \$f(x)\$ takes both positive and negative values, then the integral represents the “signed area.”

## IV. Properties of Definite Integrals

1. **Linearity**

$$
\int_a^b [\alpha f(x)+\beta g(x)]\,dx = \alpha\int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \beta\int_a^b g(x)\,dx
$$

2. **Additivity over intervals**

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_a^c f(x)\,dx + \int_c^b f(x)\,dx
$$

3. **Reversal of interval**

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = -\int_b^a f(x)\,dx
$$

4. **Order-preserving property**
   If \$f(x)\ge g(x)\$ holds on $\[a,b]\$, then

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \ge \int_a^b g(x)\,dx
$$

5. **Estimation inequality**
   If \$|f(x)|\le M\$, then

$$
\Big|\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\Big| \le M(b-a)
$$

## V. Important Definite Integral Formulas

1. Constant function

$$
\int_a^b c\,dx = c(b-a)
$$

2. Power function

$$
\int_a^b x^n\,dx = \frac{b^{n+1}-a^{n+1}}{n+1},\quad (n\ne -1)
$$

3. Exponential function

$$
\int_a^b e^x dx = e^b - e^a
$$

4. Logarithmic function

$$
\int_a^b \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln|b|-\ln|a|
$$

5. Trigonometric functions

$$
\int_a^b \sin x dx = -\cos b + \cos a
$$

$$
\int_a^b \cos x dx = \sin b - \sin a
$$

3. **Geometric meaning**: Area of a curvilinear trapezoid, including signs.
4. **Properties**: Linearity, additivity, reversal, order-preserving, estimation inequality.
5. **Common formulas**: Interval integrals of power, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.

📌 **One-Sentence Summary**:
Definite integral = limit of sums; continuous/piecewise continuous functions are always integrable; geometrically it is the area of a curvilinear trapezoid; problem-solving relies on **properties + common integral formulas**.

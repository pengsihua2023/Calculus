# Related Rates Problems

The core of this section lies in connecting the rates of change (derivatives) of different variables, commonly used in physics, geometry, and applied problems. Below is a summary of the main knowledge points:

## I. Basic Idea

1. **Core Concept**

   * Related rates problems study the **relationship between several variables changing with respect to time**.
   * If variables are connected by an equation and each variable is a function of time \$t\$, then differentiating with respect to \$t\$ establishes their rate relationship.

2. **Key Steps**

   * **Establish the relation**: find the geometric or physical relation between variables, and write it as an equation.
   * **Differentiate both sides with respect to \$t\$**: apply the **chain rule**, yielding equations involving \$\dfrac{dx}{dt}, \dfrac{dy}{dt}, \dots\$.
   * **Substitute known values**: plug in given instantaneous data to solve for the required rate.

## II. Common Formulas and Methods

### 1. Application of the Chain Rule

* If \$y=f(x)\$ and \$x=x(t)\$, then

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}
$$

### 2. Implicit Function Method

* If the relation between variables is \$F(x,y)=0\$, then

$$
\frac{dF}{dt} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}=0
$$

### 3. Parametric Form

* If \$x=\varphi(t), y=\psi(t)\$, directly compute \$\dfrac{dx}{dt}, \dfrac{dy}{dt}\$ and use geometric/physical conditions to relate them.

## III. Typical Problem Types

1. **Geometry**

   * **Circle area with changing radius**:

$$
A=\pi r^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{dA}{dt} = 2\pi r \frac{dr}{dt}
$$

* **Sphere volume with changing radius**:

$$
V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}
$$

2. **Right Triangle (Pythagorean Relation)**

   * If both legs change, use \$x^2+y^2=z^2\$:

$$
2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 2z\frac{dz}{dt}
$$

3. **Kinematics**

   * Distance formula: if two objects are on the coordinate plane, distance \$d=\sqrt{(x\_1-x\_2)^2+(y\_1-y\_2)^2}\$, differentiate with respect to time to obtain relative velocity.

4. **Circular Motion**

   * Arc length \$s=r\theta\$, differentiate with respect to time:

$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = r \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

* Sector area \$A=\tfrac12 r^2\theta \quad\Rightarrow\quad \dfrac{dA}{dt}=r \dfrac{dr}{dt}\theta + \tfrac12 r^2\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}\$

## IV. Notes

1. **Clarify variable relations**: donâ€™t rush to differentiate; first find the proper geometric or physical formula.
2. **Treat all variables as functions of \$t\$**: even if not explicitly stated in the problem.
3. **Substitute instantaneous values at the end**: avoid plugging in numbers too early.
4. **Pay attention to sign**: consider direction (increase positive, decrease negative).

## V. Exam Summary

* Able to use the **chain rule** to build rate relations.
* Familiar with **geometric formulas (area, volume, Pythagorean relation)**.
* Able to apply them to **physics problems (velocity, relative motion)**.
* Keep **signs and instantaneous values consistent** during computation.

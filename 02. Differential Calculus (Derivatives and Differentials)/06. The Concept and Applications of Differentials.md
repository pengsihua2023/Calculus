## I. Concept of Differentials

### 1. Increment Formula

Suppose \$y=f(x)\$ is differentiable at point \$x\_0\$. A variable increment \$\Delta x\$ leads to a function increment \$\Delta y=f(x\_0+\Delta x)-f(x\_0)\$.
From the definition of the derivative:

$$
\Delta y = f'(x_0)\Delta x + o(\Delta x),\quad (\Delta x\to 0)
$$

### 2. Definition of Differential

* The **differential** of a function:

$$
dy = f'(x)dx
$$

where \$dx\$ represents the increment of the independent variable, and \$dy\$ is the linear principal part closest to \$\Delta y\$.

* In other words:

$$
\Delta y \approx dy \quad (\Delta x \text{ very small})
$$

## II. Geometric Meaning

* \$dy = f'(x),dx\$ represents the **change in the ordinate of the tangent line** to the curve at point \$(x,f(x))\$.
* That is: **the differential is a linear approximation of the function increment**.
* Intuitively: \$\Delta y\$ is the actual change on the curve, while \$dy\$ is the change along the tangent line.

## III. Rules of Operation

1. **Linearity**

$$
d(u\pm v) = du \pm dv, \quad d(cu)=cdu
$$

2. **Product Rule**

$$
d(uv) = udv + vdu
$$

3. **Quotient Rule**

$$
d\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{vdu - udv}{v^2}
$$

4. **Composite Functions** (differential form of the chain rule)

$$
dy = f'(u)du,\quad du=g'(x)dx \quad \Rightarrow\quad dy=f'(g(x))g'(x)dx
$$

## IV. Applications

### 1. Approximate Calculation

Using \$\Delta y \approx dy\$:

$$
f(x+\Delta x) \approx f(x) + f'(x)\Delta x
$$

Useful in numerical approximation and error estimation.
Example: \$\sqrt{4.1}\approx \sqrt{4}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{4}}\cdot 0.1 = 2+0.025=2.025\$.

### 2. Error Estimation

* **Absolute error**: \$|\Delta y - dy|\$
* **Relative error**: \$\dfrac{\Delta y - dy}{y}\$
  Differentials are often used in engineering and physics for error estimation.

---

### 3. Composite and Implicit Functions

* If \$y=f(u), u=g(x)\$, then \$dy=f'(u)du,\ du=g'(x)dx\$.
* Implicit function: \$F(x,y)=0 \Rightarrow F\_xdx+F\_y dy=0 \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=-\dfrac{F\_x}{F\_y}\$.

### 4. Parametric Equations

If \$x=\varphi(t), y=\psi(t)\$, then

$$
dx = \varphi'(t)dt,\quad dy=\psi'(t)dt
$$

## V. Key Exam Points

1. **Definition**: \$\Delta y=f'(x)\Delta x+o(\Delta x)\$, differential \$dy=f'(x)dx\$.
2. **Geometric meaning**: tangent line change â‰ˆ curve change.
3. **Rules of operation**: addition/subtraction, product, quotient, composite (same as derivative rules).
4. **Applications**: approximation, error estimation, implicit and parametric differentiation.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:
A differential is an applied form of the derivative, approximating function increments by tangent line changes. It is useful for numerical approximation, error analysis, and as a key tool in handling composite functions, implicit functions, and parametric equations.

## I. Definition

* **First-order derivative**:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{dy}{dx}
$$

* **Higher-order derivatives**: obtained by differentiating the first derivative further.

  * **Second-order derivative**:

$$
f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)) = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
$$

* **Third-order derivative**:

$$
f^{(3)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(f''(x)) = \frac{d^3y}{dx^3}
$$

* **n-th order derivative**:

$$
f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\big(f^{(n-1)}(x)\big) = \frac{d^ny}{dx^n}
$$

---

## II. Notation

* \$f^{(n)}(x)\$ or \$\dfrac{d^n y}{dx^n}\$.
* Sometimes written as \$y^{(n)}\$.
* Special: \$f''(x)\$ denotes the second derivative, not written as \$(f')'(x)\$.

## III. Properties

1. If a function has higher-order derivatives on an interval, it is called **n-times differentiable**.
2. Higher-order derivatives still follow the basic differentiation rules (sum, product, quotient, chain rule, etc.).
3. Some functions‚Äô higher-order derivatives follow patterns that allow general formulas.

## IV. Higher-Order Derivative Formulas of Common Functions

### 1. Power Function

$$
(x^m)^{(n)} = m(m-1)(m-2)\cdots(m-n+1)x^{m-n},\quad n\le m
$$

If \$n>m\$, then the derivative is \$0\$.

---

### 2. Exponential Function

* \$(e^x)^{(n)} = e^x\$
* \$(a^x)^{(n)} = (\ln a)^n \cdot a^x\$

---

### 3. Trigonometric Functions

* \$(\sin x)^{(n)}\$ and \$(\cos x)^{(n)}\$ follow a **period-4** pattern:

$$
(\sin x)^{(n)} = \sin\left(x+n\frac{\pi}{2}\right),\quad
(\cos x)^{(n)} = \cos\left(x+n\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
$$

---

### 4. Logarithmic Function

$$
(\ln x)^{(n)} = (-1)^{n-1}\frac{(n-1)!}{x^n}, \quad n\ge 1
$$

---

## V. Common Formulas

### 1. Leibniz Formula (Higher-Order Derivative of a Product)

If \$h(x)=f(x)g(x)\$, then

$h^{(n)}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} f^{(k)}(x) g^{(n-k)}(x)$

### 2. Higher-Order Derivatives of Composite Functions (More Complex)

Generally require repeated use of the chain rule, or application of **Fa√† di Bruno‚Äôs Formula** (higher-order chain rule, usually appearing in advanced problems).

## VI. Applications

1. **Physical Meaning**

   * First derivative: velocity
   * Second derivative: acceleration
   * Third derivative: jerk
   * Higher-order derivatives: describe higher-order rates of change

2. **Geometric Meaning**

   * The second derivative reflects the concavity/convexity of a curve.
   * In graph analysis, higher-order derivatives help determine inflection points and curvature properties.

3. **Series Expansion**

   * Taylor series expansion requires higher-order derivatives.

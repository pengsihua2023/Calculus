Main knowledge points of this section, divided into two parts: **Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule** and **Infinitesimal Comparison**.

---

## I. Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule

### 1. Applicable Cases

When a limit encounters the following **indeterminate forms**, Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule may be applied:

* \$\dfrac{0}{0}\$ form
* \$\dfrac{\infty}{\infty}\$ form

### 2. Statement of the Rule

Suppose functions \$f(x), g(x)\$ are differentiable on some interval (except possibly at point \$a\$), and as \$x\to a\$:

* \$f(x)\to 0, g(x)\to 0\$, or \$f(x)\to\infty, g(x)\to\infty\$;
* and \$g'(x)\ne 0\$, if

$$
\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

exists (or equals \$\infty\$), then

$$
\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.
$$

### 3. Notes

* Must confirm the form is **0/0 or âˆž/âˆž**; other indeterminate forms need conversion.
* It may require multiple applications, not always resolved in one step.
* If conditions are not met, it **cannot** be applied, otherwise wrong conclusions may result.

### 4. Common Applications

* \$\displaystyle \lim\_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x} \overset{\text{Lâ€™Hospital}}{=} \lim\_{x\to 0}\frac{\cos x}{1} = 1\$
* \$\displaystyle \lim\_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x} \overset{\text{Lâ€™Hospital}}{=} \lim\_{x\to\infty}\frac{1/x}{1} = 0\$

## II. Infinitesimal Comparison

### 1. Definition

As \$x\to a\$:

* \$\alpha(x), \beta(x)\$ are both infinitesimals;
* If \$\dfrac{\alpha(x)}{\beta(x)} \to 0\$, then \$\alpha\$ is a **higher-order infinitesimal** relative to \$\beta\$, denoted as

$$
\alpha(x) = o(\beta(x)), \quad (x\to a)
$$

If

$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{\alpha(x)}{\beta(x)} = C \ne 0,
$$

then \$\alpha, \beta\$ are **same-order infinitesimals**.

If

$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{\alpha(x)}{\beta(x)} = 1,
$$

then \$\alpha(x)\sim \beta(x)\$ (equivalent infinitesimals).

### 2. Common Equivalent Infinitesimals (as \$x\to 0\$)

* \$\sin x \sim x\$
* \$\tan x \sim x\$
* \$\arcsin x \sim x\$
* \$\arctan x \sim x\$
* \$1-\cos x \sim \tfrac{x^2}{2}\$
* \$\ln(1+x) \sim x\$
* \$e^x-1 \sim x\$
* \$a^x-1 \sim x\ln a\$
* \$(1+x)^\alpha - 1 \sim \alpha x\$

---

### 3. Applications

* Using equivalent infinitesimals can quickly handle \$0/0\$ limits.
  Example:

$$
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\tfrac{x^2}{2}}{x^2} = \tfrac{1}{2}
$$

* Infinitesimal comparison is often more efficient than Lâ€™Hospital, avoiding cumbersome differentiation.

## III. Relationship and Differences

* **Connection**: Both methods address indeterminate limit problems.
* **Differences**:

  * Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule relies on differentiation, with broader applicability, but may require multiple steps.
  * Infinitesimal comparison is more straightforward and efficient, especially for common function limits.
* **Strategy**: Prefer **equivalent infinitesimals**; if direct comparison is difficult, then use **Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule**.

## IV. Exam Summary

1. Memorize the conditions and scope of Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule.
2. Be familiar with common equivalent infinitesimal formulas.
3. Distinguish higher-order infinitesimals, same-order infinitesimals, and equivalent infinitesimals.
4. Master complementary usage: compare first, then apply Lâ€™Hospital if needed.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:

* **Lâ€™Hospitalâ€™s Rule**: used for \$0/0, âˆž/âˆž\$ forms, resolves limits via differentiation.
* **Infinitesimal comparison**: simplifies via equivalent replacement, more efficient.

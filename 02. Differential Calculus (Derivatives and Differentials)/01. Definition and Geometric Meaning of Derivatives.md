Main knowledge points of this section. This is one of the cores of calculus, with both a rigorous limit definition and an intuitive geometric interpretation.

## I. Definition of Derivatives

### 1. Basic Definition

Suppose a function \$f(x)\$ is defined in some neighborhood of \$x\_0\$. If the limit

$$
f'(x_0) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
$$

exists, then \$f(x)\$ is said to be differentiable at \$x\_0\$, and this limit is called the **derivative** of \$f\$ at \$x\_0\$.

* Notations:

$$
f'(x_0),\quad \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=x_0},\quad y'|_{x=x_0}
$$

### 2. Equivalent Forms

* Using the ‚Äúapproach‚Äù form:

$$
f'(x_0) = \lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}
$$

* Left derivative:

$$
f'_-(x_0) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0^-}\frac{f(x_0+\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
$$

* Right derivative:

$$
f'_+(x_0) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0^+}\frac{f(x_0+\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
$$

* If the left and right derivatives both exist and are equal, then the function is differentiable at that point.

## II. Relationship Between Differentiability and Continuity

* Differentiability \$\implies\$ Continuity.
* Continuity \$\not\implies\$ Differentiability.
  Classic counterexample: \$f(x)=|x|\$ is continuous at \$x=0\$ but not differentiable (left and right derivatives are unequal).

## III. Geometric Meaning

1. **Slope of a Secant Line**

$$
\frac{f(x_0+\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
$$

represents the slope of the secant line passing through \$(x\_0, f(x\_0))\$ and \$(x\_0+\Delta x, f(x\_0+\Delta x))\$.

2. **Slope of the Tangent Line**
   As \$\Delta x \to 0\$, the secant line approaches the tangent line to the curve at \$(x\_0,f(x\_0))\$.
   Therefore:

$$
f'(x_0) = \text{slope of the tangent line at } (x_0,f(x_0))
$$

3. **Equation of the Tangent Line**
   If the tangent point is \$(x\_0,f(x\_0))\$, the tangent line equation is:

$$
y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
$$

4. **Equation of the Normal Line**
   Normal slope = \$-\tfrac{1}{f'(x\_0)}\$ (if \$f'(x\_0)\ne 0\$).
   Its equation is:

$$
y - f(x_0) = -\frac{1}{f'(x_0)}(x-x_0)
$$

## IV. Physical Meaning of Derivatives

1. **Instantaneous Rate of Change**
   In physics, the derivative often represents the rate of change of a quantity with respect to time.
   For example:

   * \$s(t)\$: displacement function,
   * \$v(t)=s'(t)\$: instantaneous velocity,
   * \$a(t)=v'(t)=s''(t)\$: instantaneous acceleration.

2. **General Rate of Change**
   If \$y=f(x)\$, then \$f'(x\_0)\$ represents the instantaneous rate of change of \$y\$ with respect to \$x\$ when \$x\$ varies near \$x\_0\$.

2. **Understand the geometric meaning**: derivative = slope of the tangent line.
3. **Master the formulas of tangent/normal line equations**.
4. **Understand the physical meaning**: derivative = instantaneous rate of change.
5. **Be able to determine differentiability** (by checking if left and right derivatives are equal).

This figure illustrates the **geometric meaning of derivatives**:

* The blue curve is the function \$y=x^2\$.
* The red point is the tangent point \$(x\_0,f(x\_0))=(1,1)\$.
* The colored dashed lines are secant lines for different \$\Delta x\$, whose slopes approach the slope of the tangent line as \$\Delta x \to 0\$.
* The red line is the tangent line, with slope \$f'(1)=2\$.

üëâ The limit of the secant slope is the tangent slope ‚Äî this is the geometric essence of derivatives.

This figure illustrates the **physical meaning of derivatives**:

* Blue curve: displacement function \$s(t)=\tfrac{1}{2}t^2\$ (uniformly accelerated motion).
* Green dashed line: secant line, representing the **average velocity** over interval $\[t\_0,t\_1]\$.
* Red line: tangent line, representing the **instantaneous velocity** at \$t\_0=2\$, whose slope equals the derivative \$s'(t\_0)=t\_0=2\$.

üëâ Thus: **the derivative is the instantaneous rate of change**, often corresponding to ‚Äúinstantaneous velocity‚Äù in physics.

Main knowledge points of this section, divided into four parts: definition, methods, typical formulas, and applications.

## I. Differentiation of Implicit Functions

### 1. Concept

* **Implicit function**: The independent variable \$x\$ and dependent variable \$y\$ satisfy an equation

$$
F(x,y)=0
$$

and \$y=f(x)\$ cannot (or is inconvenient to) be explicitly solved. In this case, \$y\$ is called an implicit function defined by \$F(x,y)=0\$.

### 2. Method of Implicit Differentiation

* Differentiate both sides of \$F(x,y)=0\$ with respect to \$x\$, using the **chain rule**:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}F(x,y) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
$$

* Solve for \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}\$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{F_x}{F_y}, \quad \text{where } F_x = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x},\ F_y = \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}.
$$

### 3. Higher-Order Derivatives

* To find the second derivative, differentiate \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}\$ again with respect to \$x\$, and use the implicit relation to eliminate \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}\$.

## II. Differentiation of Parametric Equations

### 1. Concept

If a curve is given by a parameter \$t\$:

$$
x = \varphi(t),\quad y = \psi(t)
$$

where \$\varphi, \psi\$ are functions of \$t\$.

### 2. First Derivative

* By the chain rule:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} = \frac{\psi'(t)}{\varphi'(t)}, \quad \varphi'(t)\ne 0
$$

### 3. Second Derivative

* Differentiate \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}\$ again with respect to \$x\$:

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{dx/dt}
$$

## III. Typical Applications

1. **Implicit Form of a Circle**

   * \$x^2+y^2=r^2\$, implicit differentiation:

$$
2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{y}
$$

2. **Parametric Form of a Circle**

   * Parametric equations: \$x=r\cos (t),\ y=r\sin (t)\$.
   * First derivative:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} = \frac{r\cos (t)}{-r\sin (t)} = -\cot (t)
$$

* Same result as from implicit differentiation.

## IV. Summary (Key Points)

1. **Implicit Differentiation**

   * Principle: Differentiate both sides of \$F(x,y)=0\$, applying the chain rule.
   * Formula: \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=-\dfrac{F\_x}{F\_y}\$.

2. **Parametric Differentiation**

   * Formula: \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}\$,
   * $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\dfrac{d}{dt}(\dfrac{dy}{dx})\cdot \dfrac{1}{dx/dt}\$.

3. **Application Scenarios**

   * Use implicit differentiation when an explicit function form is inconvenient.
   * Parametric form is often used for circles, ellipses, cycloids, and other curves.

ðŸ“Œ **One-Sentence Summary**:

* **Implicit differentiation** = differentiate both sides of the equation + apply the chain rule.
* **Parametric differentiation** = \$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}\$.
